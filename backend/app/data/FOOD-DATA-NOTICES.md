data used in the database or databases may represent an average of the nutrient
content of a particular sample of foods and ingredients, determined at a particular
time. The nutrient composition of foods and ingredients can vary substantially
between batches and brands because of a number of factors, including changes in
season, processing practices and ingredient source, and methods of calculation.
